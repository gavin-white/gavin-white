### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Gavin. I study Computer Science at **Northeastern University**.
My favorite classes so far include
  * Object Oriented Design
  * Algorithms & Data
  * Computer Systems

At Northeastern I've been both a **Teaching Assistant** and **Peer Tutor** for Object-Oriented Design and Fundamentals of Computer Science.

I am currently a **Software Engineer Co-op** at Wayfair where I contribute to a professional development team in the financial technology space.

I love learning about all aspects of computing and programming, sharing my knowledge with others, and creating!
