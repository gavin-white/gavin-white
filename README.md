### Hi there 👋
I'm Gavin. I study Computer Science at **Northeastern University**.
My favorite classes so far include
  * Object Oriented Design
  * Algorithms & Data
  * Computer Systems
  * Programming Languages

At Northeastern I've been both a **teaching assistant** and **peer tutor** for Object-Oriented Design and Fundamentals of Computer Science, and am currently a **teaching assistant** for Computer Systems.

I have experience as a **software engineer co-op** at Wayfair where I collaborated as part of a professional development team in the financial technology space.

I love learning about all aspects of computing and programming, sharing my knowledge with others, and creating!
