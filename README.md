### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Gavin. I study Computer Science at **Northeastern University**.
My favorite classes so far include
  * Object Oriented Design
  * Algorithms & Data
  * Computer Systems

Since 2021, I've been a **Teaching Assistant** and I'm currently a **Lead TA** for Fundamentals of Computer Science 2 where I
  * Teach programming concepts to a lab of 35+ students
  * Hold weekly office hours to individually tutor students
  * Grade assignments, providing feedback on semantic and stylistic correctness

I love learning about all aspects of computing and programming, sharing my knowledge with others, and creating!
